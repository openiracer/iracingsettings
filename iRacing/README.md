# iRacing Settings

A comprehensive collection of optimized iRacing settings and configurations for various aspects of sim racing.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into modules, each focusing on specific aspects of iRacing configuration:

### Core Settings (`/core`)
- `app.ini` - Main application settings
- `core.ini` - Core system configuration
- `renderDX11.ini` - DirectX 11 rendering settings
- `rendererDX11Monitor.ini` - Monitor-specific rendering configuration

Additional modules will be added in their respective directories.

## Current Configuration

### Hardware Setup
- Wheel: Moza R12 with Vision wheel
- Audio: JBL Quantum One headset
- Bass Shakers: Connected via S/PDIF
- Focus: Open-wheel racing
